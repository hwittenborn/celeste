### Help support Celeste
Hey! I'm Hunter Wittenborn, the creator and maintainer of Celeste.

I've had a blast working on Celeste in the time I've had available, but I'm currently not able to put all the time I'd like into it. I'm a university student which keeps me busy at times, but I also have part-time jobs on the side that keep me quite busy, even when I'm not occupied with my school work.

If you'd like to help me keep driving Celeste forward, I humbly ask that you consider [sponsoring my work](https://github.com/sponsors/hwittenborn). With your help, I can use more of my time on Celeste's development, allowing it to flourish into a program that people everywhere can use!
