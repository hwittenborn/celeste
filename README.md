### Help support Celeste
Hey! I'm Hunter Wittenborn, the creator and maintainer of Celeste.

I've had a blast working on Celeste in the time I've had available, but I'm currently not able to put all the time I'd like into it. I'm a university student which keeps me busy at times, but I also have part-time jobs on the side that keep me quite busy, even when I'm not occupied with my school work.

If you'd like to help me keep driving Celeste forward, I humbly ask that you consider [sponsoring my work](https://github.com/sponsors/hwittenborn). With your help, I can use more of my time on Celeste's development, allowing it to flourish into a program that people everywhere can use!

### Community-Maintained

#### AUR (Arch Linux)
> This package is maintained by [Mark Wagie](https://github.com/yochananmarqos).

If you're on Arch Linux, you can install Celeste from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/celeste).

You can install it with your preferred [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers) such as [Yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) or [Paru](https://github.com/morganamilo/paru) (recommended):

```sh
# Yay
yay -S celeste

# Paru
paru -S celeste
```

or you can install it manually with [makepkg](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/makepkg):

```sh
git clone 'https://aur.archlinux.org/celeste'
cd celeste/
makepkg -si
```

Note that you'll have to manually update Celeste if you install with makepkg though.

## Support
Celeste has multiple communication rooms available if you need assistance, want to talk about the project, or to just hang around with some fellow users:
- Discord: https://discord.gg/congress
- Matrix: https://matrix.to/#/#celeste:gnome.org

**Bugs and features can be discussed in the rooms if you feel like there's information that should be talked about, but such should ultimately fall into the [issue tracker](https://github.com/hwittenborn/celeste/issues).**
